# A1 Starter Code

This a simple setup to help you test and implement A1.

We've copied the starter function templates we provided you into one index.ts file, and then added some libraries and config files to help you get started.

-   Jest, a testing framework so you can unit test each function.
-   Babel, for compiling TS to JS.

## Commands to get started

Set-Up:

-   `yarn` - Install all dependencies.

    Run this first!

Test:

-   `yarn test` - Run all tests.

    We've provided some out-of-the-box tests to help you get started. If your implemented code passes all our tests, that DOES NOT mean we guarantee you've done everything correctly, but it probably _does_ mean you're off to a good start.

Run:

-   `yarn build` - Build the project (compile TS to JS)
-   `yarn start` - Run the project (run the compiled JS)

    This will execute your code in the command line (including printing console.logs, etc.).

## Relevant Files

-   `index.ts` - This is where you'll write your code! This is the only relevant file you'll be submitting to us.
